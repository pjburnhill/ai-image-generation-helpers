Natural Language Processing (NLP) Tasks and Uses:

1. Text Preprocessing:
   - Clean and preprocess text data for NLP tasks.
   - Tokenize, stem, and lemmatize words to reduce them to their base or root form.

2. Text Analysis:
   - Extract insights and patterns from textual data.
   - Analyze sentiment, emotions, and other subjective information from text.

3. Named Entity Recognition (NER):
   - Identify and classify named entities in text, such as names, places, and dates.
   - Extract structured information from unstructured text.

4. Part-of-Speech Tagging:
   - Classify words into their respective parts of speech, such as nouns, verbs, adjectives, etc.
   - Analyze the grammatical structure of sentences.

5. Machine Translation:
   - Translate text from one language to another.
   - Use models that consider context and semantics for accurate translations.

6. Text Classification:
   - Categorize text into predefined classes or labels.
   - Implement tasks like spam detection, topic classification, and more.

7. Information Retrieval:
   - Retrieve relevant documents or information based on user queries.
   - Implement search engines and recommendation systems.

8. Text Generation:
   - Generate coherent and contextually relevant text based on certain inputs or prompts.
   - Implement chatbots, content generators, and more.

9. Speech Recognition:
   - Convert spoken language into written text.
   - Implement voice assistants, transcription services, and more.

10. Text Summarization:
   - Extract key points and generate concise summaries of long texts.
   - Implement automatic summarization for articles, reports, and more.

11. Word Embeddings:
   - Convert words or phrases into numerical vectors that capture semantic meaning.
   - Use embeddings for similarity calculations, clustering, and other tasks.

12. Topic Modeling:
   - Identify topics or themes in large collections of text.
   - Use algorithms like Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for topic extraction.
