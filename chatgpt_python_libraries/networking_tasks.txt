Networking & Communication Tasks and Uses:

1. HTTP Requests:
   - Send and receive HTTP requests to communicate with web servers.
   - Handle different HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.

2. WebSockets:
   - Implement real-time bidirectional communication between clients and servers.
   - Build interactive applications that require instant data updates.

3. Network Protocols:
   - Implement and manage various network communication protocols.
   - Ensure data transmission adheres to specific standards and formats.

4. Data Serialization and Deserialization:
   - Convert data to a format suitable for transmission over networks.
   - Parse received data to extract meaningful information.

5. Secure Communication:
   - Implement encryption and other security measures for safe data transmission.
   - Use protocols like SSL/TLS for encrypted communication.

6. Network Monitoring and Analysis:
   - Monitor network traffic and analyze data packets.
   - Identify potential issues, bottlenecks, or malicious activities.

7. File Transfer:
   - Transmit files over networks using protocols like FTP, SFTP, and SCP.
   - Ensure efficient and reliable file transfer between devices.

8. Remote Procedure Calls (RPC):
   - Execute functions or procedures on remote servers.
   - Use protocols like gRPC or JSON-RPC for RPC communication.

9. Messaging and Queues:
   - Implement message-driven processing architectures.
   - Use message brokers and queue systems for asynchronous communication.

10. Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Communication:
   - Establish direct communication channels between devices without central servers.
   - Implement P2P networks for tasks like file sharing, streaming, and more.

11. Network Configuration and Management:
   - Configure network settings and manage connected devices.
   - Monitor and maintain network health and performance.

12. VPN and Tunneling:
   - Establish virtual private networks for secure and private communication.
   - Tunnel network traffic through encrypted channels.
