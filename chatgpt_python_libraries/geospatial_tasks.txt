Geospatial & Mapping Tasks and Uses:

1. Map Visualization:
   - Display geospatial data on interactive maps.
   - Use various map styles, layers, and overlays to represent data.

2. Geocoding and Reverse Geocoding:
   - Convert addresses into geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude).
   - Convert geographic coordinates back into human-readable addresses.

3. Spatial Analysis:
   - Analyze spatial data to identify patterns, relationships, and trends.
   - Perform operations like buffer analysis, intersection, and union.

4. Route and Distance Calculation:
   - Calculate optimal routes between multiple points.
   - Determine distances and travel times based on different transportation modes.

5. Geospatial Data Formats:
   - Handle and manipulate various geospatial data formats like GeoJSON, KML, and Shapefiles.
   - Convert between different formats and ensure data integrity.

6. Spatial Databases:
   - Store and retrieve geospatial data in specialized databases.
   - Perform spatial queries and operations using database functions.

7. Elevation and Terrain Analysis:
   - Analyze elevation data to derive insights about the terrain.
   - Identify features like hills, valleys, slopes, and more.

8. Satellite Imagery:
   - Process and analyze satellite images.
   - Extract features, land cover types, and other information from imagery.

9. Geospatial Machine Learning:
   - Apply machine learning techniques to geospatial data.
   - Implement tasks like land cover classification, object detection in satellite imagery, and more.

10. Geographic Projections:
   - Convert data between different coordinate systems and projections.
   - Ensure accurate representation of data on maps.

11. Geofencing and Location-based Services:
   - Implement location-based triggers and notifications.
   - Define geographic boundaries for specific actions or alerts.
